      "The Partition of India was a division that took place in 1947 which marked the end of the British Raj and resulted in the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. The partition was done on the basis of religious demographics, leading to a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",

      "This partition led to a mass migration of people from both sides, which was accompanied by large scale violence, rioting, and communal tensions. It is estimated that approximately 10-15 million people were uprooted from their homelands making it the largest mass migration in human history. The death toll of partition-related violence ranges from 200,000 to 2 million people.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note also that the partition left a significant impact on the socio-political stance of both countries, fostering a long-standing conflict particularly over the region of Jammu and Kashmir.\n",
      "\n",
      "The event of partition is seen as a traumatic period in the history of both India and Pakistan, and its effects are still noticeable to this day in the relations between the two countries. The Partition of India significantly altered the history of the entire South Asian region and continues to shape Indo-Pakistani relations.\n"
